VERSE 1:<br>
1 Once with brother<br>
2 My mother was no mother<br>
1 She didn’t really care<br>
2 That I’d rather eat air<br>
1 I said it wasn’t fair<br>

Chorus: (Together)<br>
I hate big peas and I cannot lie<br>
You other peeps can’t deny<br>
When my mum walks in with a plate of peas<br>
I just think oh why me<br>

VERSE 2:<br>
1 When I first saw a pea<br>
2 I thought OMG<br>
1 My mum said she’ll count till three<br>
2 Gulp it down your throat<br>
1 But why can’t she see<br>
2 That this is not the key<br>
1 To healthy me<br>

Chorus: (Together)<br>
I hate big peas and I cannot lie<br>
You other peeps can’t deny<br>
When my mum walks in with a plate of peas<br>
I just think oh why me<br>
 
Verse 3:<br>
1 I said NO VEGETABLES<br>
2 Mother said Not acceptable<br>
1 Its part of your diet<br>
2 Be good and be quiet<br>
1 Mother is mean<br>
2 I don’t like beans!<br>


Chorus: (Together)<br>
I hate big peas and I cannot lie<br>
You other peeps can’t deny<br>
When my mum walks in with a plate of peas<br>
I just think oh why me<br>

Outro: <br>
1 I think that food is RAD<br>

(Together )Do you hate vegetables too?<br>
