VERSE 1:<br>
1 Once with brother<br>
2 My mother was no mother<br>
1 She didnt really care<br>
2 That Id rather eat air<br>
1 I said it wasnt fair<br>

Chorus: (Together)<br>
I hate big peas and I cannot lie<br>
You other peeps cant deny<br>
When my mum walks in with a plate of peas<br>
I just think oh why me<br>

VERSE 2:<br>
1 When I first saw a pea<br>
2 I thought OMG<br>
1 My mum said shell count till three<br>
2 Gulp it down your throat<br>
1 But why cant she see<br>
2 That this is not the key<br>
1 To healthy me<br>

When my mum walks in with a plate of peas<br>
I just think oh why me<br>
 
Verse 3:<br>
